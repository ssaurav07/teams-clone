## How to use

## Agile

I have adopted the **Scrum** methodology for the development of the product. I divided the month of the program into five sprints , four of one week each and the last sprint was a half-week long. 

Before every sprint I used to set a target for that week/sprint and then work on that.

**Sprint 1** : The first sprint started from 9th June , I started planning about how to develop and design my website. I made a basic prototype of what features I was going to include and how. Later I added the mandatory feature to my website.
<p align="center">
<img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/c7e7kqy42zkbkaa/Screenshot%20%2820%29.png?dl=0&raw=1"></p><br>

After Sprint 1 was over I took feedback from my friends and family about what actually they would have wanted from an app like MS teams. I noted them and then worked upon them accordingly.

**Sprint 2 and 3** : Now that I had mandatory feature already built and also got my mentor assigned to me , in Sprint 2 and 3 , I worked upon adding additional features to my website. During this phase/sprint I used to continuously take inputs from my mentor and friends and then modify my product as per the needs.

</p>

**Sprint 4** : Now this was the sprint when we were assigned the **Adopt Feature** . This new feature was very different and something beyond my expectations and so I had to make some changes in my database to work on this feature . Also I had to dive deeper into the  world of **Web sockets** in order to link my teams conversation outside the room to that happening inside the room and that too in real time. But because I had a very structured and organized workspace I didn't face much of the difficulties and achieved it successfully.

</p><br>

**Sprint 5** : This was the last sprint I had in the development phase. I was close to the delivery date so I basically took feedbacks from mentors and other people around me on the UI of my product and then improved the UI of my app to a great extent. This added beauty to my product and made it delivery ready as well.
